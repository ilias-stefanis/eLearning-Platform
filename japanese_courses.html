            <p>This MITx course was developed in collaboration with HarvardX and is co-taught by MIT, Harvard,
                and Duke historians. You will examine Japanese history in a new way—through the images created
                by those who were there—and the skills and questions involved in reading history through images
                in the digital format.
                <br><br> The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize”
                the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization,
                in Commodore Perry's 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo's 1905 Hibiya Riot;
                and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.

            <p>This course teaches Japanese law. It covers the legal system and basic concepts.
                The course starts with the study of concepts that are common to many countries,
                such as sovereignty, constitution, separation of three rights, basic human rights
                and personal security. Furthermore, it covers current issues in Japan, for example,
                those faced in daily life from a legal perspective based upon laws and related practices.
                By studying Japanese law, you learn about the relationship between law and
                contemporary Japanese culture and society, and then can compare
                it to the law of other countries.
